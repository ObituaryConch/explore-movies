Exploratory Data Analysis of MetaCritic Movie ratings from Kaggle. 

In this initial review of the data I had to update the Duration, and Number of Persons Voting to a numeric rather than a string in order to obtain numbers for those. 

It is interesting to note that the average Rating goes down as we get closer to present times, there also has been a drop off in new movies recently, however until 2020 the number of movies developed increased. 

This analysis was only for the basic numbers and to see if there were any trends to speak of overall. 

It is also interesting that the best Directors for Average Ratings are not the ones you think make the best movies like Stephen Spielberg, it would be interesting to see if the Directors that are in the top 10 only have a couple of movies/1 movie with a high rating. 

Additional Analysis would be beneficial here.
